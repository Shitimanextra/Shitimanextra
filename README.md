# Hello all you troglodytes!

I'm a guy who goes by many names hehheuh, my favs bein' Lelouch and Andy. Go for any nicknames idm. Just don't call me a slur, but actually.. you can i'll most likely find it funny tbh.
Um, i like to write like A LOT and i really enjoy roleplay of any kind. Though i don't roleplay very much because of the terrible fear of other people. But i'll glady rp if asked, like please as i love any kind of story i promise. And if a like a persona i play durin' said rp, i might just take it and make it my personality. 
Um what else uh... I have a bf his Github is linked so check him out bcs he's so cool. and- um..
I like to cut off words that end with "ing" like idk if its weird, but it's a reccuring thing where ill just cut off said words like, "getting" or "seeing"..(its not often though i might spell correctly or i might not idk)
EX: "I feel like gettin' the huzz is extremely easy. If you can't then that's a skill issue." (also i rlly wanted to write that i thought it was funny please laugh.)
Um if you type slow i will say smth along the lines of "dang writing a whole paragraph i see." it's always a joke, um it's just an EXTREME pet peeve of mine. Like it actually kinda makes me mad. so if you type slow as fuck iwc please! 
Anyone who wants to be friends are welcome! But like most ppl have please don't int (prefferably) if your under 16. Like idm if your under that but.. it's just a little awkward yk?
I'm a great listener and i always will offer advice no matter what. And if your scared to int bc u might pmo..! Still do int bcs contrary to popular belief.. i can literally take anything/gen. Like.. i find most insults (As LONG as i know ur bein FUNNY. or trying to JOKE.) extremely funny.
Ok sorry for the whole yap fest, i didnt wanna put this on my straw bc that would make it ugly. But yeah cool? cool.
